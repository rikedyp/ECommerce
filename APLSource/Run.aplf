⍝ ISSUES
⍝ carrying around these nested structures might be okay for exploratory analysis
⍝ but it must be very expensive for an application
⍝ can we get a similar amount of expressiveness cheaper?
⍝ dataframe namespaces might be one way
 ⍝ df.(header data)
 ⍝ From, _SortBy, Join etc. then handle these namespaces?
